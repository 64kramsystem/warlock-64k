# Warlock-64k (WIP)

Rust port of the Warlock project, from the [Tricks of the Game-Programming Gurus](https://www.amazon.com/Tricks-Game-Programming-Gurus-Andre-Lamothe/dp/0672305070) book.

Note that the book falsely advertises the project as a Doom-like game, while it's actually only a renderer (no game logic) using unoptimized DDA ray casting (same principle as Wolfenstein 3D).
